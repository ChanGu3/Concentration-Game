# Concentration-Game

Created in the Unreal Engine.

This Is A Demo Version Of A possible real product.

The Game Is As Follows,

Options And How To Play buttons do not have any functionality backing them

choose how many cards you wanna play with at the menu and then start game.

press escape(esc) to open pause menu when in matching.

Depending On How Many cards you pick you then match two cards by clikcing a card on the table that are the same and you recieve a point but in this
case its more like you found a match.

I intended to flush it out more and if I were to do more the list below would be a TODO List
- Award System
- options
- how to play
- CountDown Versions
- Over All Look
- Multiplayer
